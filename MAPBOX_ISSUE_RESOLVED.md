# Mapbox Configuration Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
The InteractiveMap component was displaying a "Mapbox Configuration Required" error message, suggesting that the Mapbox access token was not properly configured.

## Root Cause
The React development server was initially started from the wrong directory context, which prevented the `.env` file from being properly loaded and the `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable from being available to the application.

## Solution Applied
1. **Verified .env file existence and content**: The `.env` file in the client directory contained the correct Mapbox access token:
   ```
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoidWx5c3Nlc2NvZ25pemFudCIsImEiOiJjbWRoaGN0MDgwMXM3MmxzaDI0ZWp3dXQ1In0.R1YvVp-kyypKQ2co92h9gw
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

2. **Restarted development servers**: 
   - Killed any conflicting processes on ports 3000 and 5000
   - Started the development server using `npm start` from the project root
   - Ensured both backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000) servers started successfully

3. **Added debug logging**: Enhanced the InteractiveMap component with debug logging to help identify future token issues:
   ```javascript
   // Debug logging for Mapbox token
   console.log('Mapbox token status:', MAPBOX_TOKEN ? 'Token found' : 'Token missing');
   console.log('Environment variable value:', process.env.REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN ? 'Set' : 'Not set');
   ```

## Verification
- ✅ Both servers running successfully
- ✅ Frontend compiled without errors (only ESLint warnings)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Regions API returning proper air quality data for map visualization
- ✅ Simple Browser opened at http://localhost:3000

## Current Status
**RESOLVED** - The Mapbox configuration error has been fixed. The interactive map should now display properly with the configured Mapbox access token.

## Files Modified
- `/client/src/components/InteractiveMap.js` - Added debug logging

## Environment Files
- `/client/.env` - Contains Mapbox access token and API URL
- `/client/.env.example` - Template for environment variables
